# Quick verdict

**File 2 is better as a starting point** because it expresses the layout structure more clearly (`.allinfo` → column, `.items` → row, `.item` → individual card). That makes the markup easier to read and the CSS easier to extend.

However — File 2 has a few practical problems (fixed `.item` width, images with forced height, possible footer overlap) that make File 1’s **responsiveness** and some choices (like `max-width` on `.info`) slightly preferable in isolation. The best choice is to keep File 2’s clearer structure but fix a few issues. Below I explain why and give a small improved CSS you can drop in.

# Comparison (short)

* **Structure / semantics**

  * **File 2 wins.** Class names match layout roles (`.allinfo`, `.items`, `.item`) making intent clear.
  * File 1 is simpler but less explicit (only `.container` and `.info`).

* **Responsiveness**

  * **File 1 has an advantage** because `.info { max-width: 200px; }` adapts better to small screens.
  * File 2 uses `.item { width: 200px; }` which can cause horizontal overflow on narrow screens.

* **Reusability & flexibility**

  * File 2’s split into column container + inner row is more flexible for complex layouts (easy to reorder, change gaps, etc.).

* **Accessibility / layout robustness**

  * Both files force `img { width:100px; height:100px; }` — that breaks aspect ratio. Use `width` or `max-width` plus `height: auto` instead.
  * The fixed footer from both files can overlap
